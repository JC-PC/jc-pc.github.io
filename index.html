				A gaming computer is a PC designed specifically for playing video games. There are a few things that differ a gaming PC from a regular PC, such as one you might use for school or work. A computer designed to run games must have a good graphics card, which might not be available on a lot of computers. It also needs a good processor and a fair amount of RAM. Aside from these things, you can choose to buy a specialty keyboard, mouse, or monitor designed for maximum gaming ability. When you have all these things, games will run beautifully and smoothly to give you the best experience possible.

				Consoles have been around for many years and are in fact just computers that sit in your living room. Okay, so there&#39;s no difference right? Wrong. Consoles do not have very advanced hardware and tend to lag or have subpar graphics and framerates. With a PC, you can run the same game (and thousands more games) better so it looks and plays nicer. When playing on a computer built for gaming, you will definitely notice the difference between the two. Another thing about PC&#39;s is that unlike a console, you can continually upgrade individual parts, instead of having to buy an entire new system 4 years later. A PC could potentially last you for the next 20 years (with upgrades along the way) and still play blockbuster games amazingly. On top of that, you can still use a console controller on many PC games!

				Of course, this is a big selling point of PC&#39;s. On a PC, there are over 800 million games available. Most of these games are very cheap, even cheaper than on consoles, where the Xbox One has a measly 900 games. There are many sales on PC games throughout the year, and there are more than just the blockbuster games available. You can get almost every game available on consoles, and then almost 900,000 times as many games after that.

				Why have one built instead of buying a prebuilt (such as Alienware)?

		<div class="roboto tWhite info-text">

			<p>
				
				There are many suppliers out there of gaming computers, but the simple truth is that you are paying for the brand name. Suppliers like this can charge up to twice as much for the same exact computer. Sure, it will run games beautifully, but so will a computer that costs half as much. In addition to being cheaper, your customization on gaming rigs that are prebuilt is limited, opposed to being able to choose everything down to the LED strips on one that you built yourself. For example, the Alienware, &#34;Light Up the Sky&#34; build that is priced at $1500 can be built for less than $900 by JC PC.
